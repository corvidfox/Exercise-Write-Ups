# What is this?

This is a basic showcase of my "Whiskies" Project. I originally wrote the project in Python, and translated it into R.

The exercise originated from my completion of Week 4, Case Study 1 of the free access version of Harvard EdX course ["Using Python for Research"](https://www.edx.org/course/using-python-for-research) in July 2022. 

It was intended to be an exercise to demonstrate the use of Bokeh for interactive visualizations of data. 

# Python:
I completed my expansion write-up in Python in November 2022. 

NumPy, Pandas, PyPlot, Scikit-Learn, and Bokeh libraries were used. 

The Python example consists of a Jupyter notebook: \
- Whiskies Write-Up.ipynb

The Bokeh visualizations for the Python version do not generate contained within the Jupyter notebook. They are included in this repository. \

- Whiskeys by Region - Sorted by Region.html
- Whiskeys by Region - Unmodified.html
- Whiskeys by Group.html
- Whiskey Locations and Regions.html
- Whiskey Locations and Groups.html

# R:
I began my R translation in February 2022.


The R versions consist of a R notebook:
Whiskies Write-Up(R).Rmd
Whiskies Write-Up(R).nb.html

GitHub does not render RNotebooks, but by downloading the RNotebook and opening in a web browser, you should be able to visualize all the data, including rBokeh visualizations.

Tidyverse, Janitor, sjmisc, ComplexHeatmap, and rBokeh libraries were used.
